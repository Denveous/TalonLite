# TalonX 

> **This is a fork of the Talon (v1.1.4) debloat tool made by the [Raven Development Team](https://ravendevteam.org/)**

> **This version is modified to run __mostly__ (check note below) without an internet connection and includes some minor tweaks to the original code.** 

> **To install a web browser a internet connection is still required, but an option to skip this was added if you already have a replacement for Microsoft Edge**

**TalonX** is a simple utility to debloat Windows in just a few clicks. 🖱️
