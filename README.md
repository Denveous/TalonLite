# TalonLite 

> **This is a fork of the Talon (v1.1.4) debloat tool made by the [Raven Development Team](https://ravendevteam.org/)**

> **This version is modified to run *__mostly__* without an internet connection and includes some minor tweaks to the original code.** 

> **Make sure to install a web browser other than Microsoft Edge as it will be removed in the process.**

**TalonLite** is a simple utility to debloat Windows in just a few clicks. 🖱️
